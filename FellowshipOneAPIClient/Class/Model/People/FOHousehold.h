 FellowshipOneAPIClient is a Cocoa Touch static library responsibile for constrcuting
 well formed signed OAuth requests to the Fellowship One API. The library promises to 
 eliminate the need to understand the inner workings of OAuth and signing to allow 
 developers to quickly get up and running building cocoa touch applications that
 integrate with the Fellowship One API
 
 For more information on OAUTH, please visit http://www.oauth.net
